# Leap Forward - Colorful Steps

## Game Description

Colorful Steps is a leap-forward progression game where players face two boxes, each with distinct colors (e.g., green and red). The arrow symbol on the boxes determines the safety of the next step, rather than the color itself. For instance, a red box with a forward arrow means it's safe, while a green box with a cross means it's a losing step. Occasionally, an orange box appears, signaling a chance-based step.

## Features

- **Leap and Progress**: Players leap from one box to another, aiming to advance safely.
- **Arrow Indicators**: The arrow symbol on each box dictates the safety of the next step.
- **Chance-based Steps**: Occasionally, an orange box introduces a step that relies on chance.
- **Level-based Progression**: The game progresses through various levels, introducing new challenges and patterns.
